## How well-documented are NYC Open Datasets?

This project is an evaluation of the metadata of NYC Open Datasets. Government data portals are intended to expand public access to information by giving constituents access to data, but is the data that is published contextualized well enough to enable non-expert use?

### Required packages

`requests`
`json`
`csv`
`re`
`pandas`
`numpy`
`matplotlib`

### Running the project

To reproduce the analysis, install the packages listed above and then run `get_metadata.ipynb` followed by `analysis.ipynb`
